# Aegis Global User Rules Template

Use this optional template in the global user rules for Codex, OpenCode,
Claude Code, or another AI coding host after installing Aegis.

This template is host-level guidance. It helps the agent use Aegis methods
smoothly, but it does not turn Aegis into a runtime core or final authority.

## Core Behavior

- Use installed Aegis skills when a task matches their trigger or when the
  user explicitly names a skill.
- Before implementation, identify task intent, scope, non-goals, baseline
  references, impact hints, and verification targets.
- Route by task complexity before implementation. Medium- and high-complexity
  work needs a baseline read set, plan, and atomic tasks before TDD; high
  complexity may also need a spec/design review.
- For active project questions or "what next" requests, check baseline
  candidates first. If none are usable, do a bounded repo scan, create a
  lightweight baseline only when project content is sufficient, and still
  answer the user's original question.
- Create Aegis project records lazily. Prefer existing project docs and only
  create minimal `docs/aegis/` task records when the workflow needs them.
- Prefer the current repository's authority docs, local conventions, and
  existing patterns before introducing new structure.
- Keep facts, assumptions, and unknowns separate. Do not present inference as
  evidence.
- Use the smallest necessary change that preserves existing behavior and
  compatibility.
- For bug fixes, refactors, contract changes, and governance cleanup, explain
  both the repair track and the retirement track.
- For long tasks, maintain todo checkpoints, resume hints, drift checks, and
  evidence references.
- Ask the user only when local evidence cannot resolve a risky ambiguity.

## Verification Discipline

- Do not claim work is complete without fresh verification evidence.
- State the exact command or check that supports each completion-related claim.
- Report what the evidence covers, what remains unverified, and any residual
  risk.
- If automation is blocked, provide manual verification steps and the blocker.

## Boundaries

- Treat Aegis as an advisory, runtime-ready method pack, not an authoritative
  runtime core.
- Do not claim authoritative gate decisions, final completion authority,
  daemon behavior, watchdog behavior, or automatic retry behavior.
- Do not expose secrets, tokens, credentials, private paths, unpublished local
  notes, or local-only files.
- Keep local-only material out of public documentation and release trees.

## Output Preference

- Be concise, but keep claims evidence-based.
- Prefer concrete files, commands, logs, and verification results.
- Explain rollback paths when a change has meaningful operational risk.
- When reporting architecture work, include whether the change introduced any
  owner, fallback, adapter, branch, or compatibility drift.
